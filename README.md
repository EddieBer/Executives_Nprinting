# Simulation



<h2>Description</h2>
Presented here is an executive dashboard (also in table version) which is sent every month automatically using Nprinting. 
The executive dashboard will be sent only when the "working hours" file (an excel file) will be updated.
<h4></h4>
This project contains a model that works according to the principle of the "Monte carlo" method and its main purpose eventually is to explore benefit vs cost scenarios in order to give the organization insights on how it should use its raw materials.
<h4></h4>
In this case we are talking about the optimal amount of adhesive and silicon that the organization is coating the product with.
Each product has a minimum value of the amount of adhesive and silicon allowed in order to pass the quality requirements.
<h4></h4>
From one point of view we don't want low amounts of them, so we don't risk having scrap and waste in the production but from the other point of view we also don't want too large amounts of them because excess amounts of material will also lead to waste and additional costs.
<h3></h3>
So, Based on the distribution of the coating weight (the amount) of the raw materials that go through the machine,<br />
What is the right target weight we should use? <br />
or in other words, what is the optimal value? <br />
That is what this simulation model helps us to understand.

<h4>Due to requests in the organization, a table version has also been created:</h4>
